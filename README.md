## 🎮 An Autoclicker for Idle Games with Sublooping Functionality

Regy's AC is an autoclicker designed specifically for idle games, featuring sublooping capabilities that set it apart from standard autoclickers.

## ✨ Features

- **Custom Click Sequences**: Define click patterns bound to specific windows and window-relative locations
- **Nested Loops**: Create loops inside the main loop with configurable repetition counts
- **Easy Editing**: Basic editing functionality for your click sequences
- **Rebindable Keys**: Rebindable Start/Stop clicking and Pick Click keybinds.
- **Save & Load**: Save your click lists for later use

## ❌ Limitations

- No support for loops inside of loops (single-level nesting only)
- No keystroke automation
- Cannot make breakfast (unless you're playing a breakfast-making game)

## 🚀 Getting Started
