An Autoclicker for idle games with a sublooping function

I made it heavily using AI because I wanted an autoclicker with a multiple loop fucntion inside the main loop.

What it does:
- Click acording to a list of clicks binded to windows and window relative locations.
- Add Loops inside to be able to have a set amount of repetition of clicks.
- Basic editing of list of clicks.
- Saving list for later.

What it doesn't:
- Loops inside of loops.
- Keystrokes.
- Breakfast (unless you are playing a breakfast making game).

Credits to Claude.ai for helping my lazy ass make something in my non-working hours when my brain is fried.
